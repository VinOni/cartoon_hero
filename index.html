		<h2>About Cypher</h2>
		<p>Cypher gathers secrets, knowledge, and intel, including retrieving the passwords of everyone in the VALORANT Protocol. He keeps most of this information to himself and only shares it for a price. In contrast to how well he knows his allies, he prefers that they know nothing about him.</p>
